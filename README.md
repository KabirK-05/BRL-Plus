# BRL+

BRL+ is a low-cost braille printer built by transforming an ordinary 3D printer into a functional braille embosser for under **$10**. Traditional braille printers cost thousands of dollars, making access to written information a luxury for many visually impaired individuals, schools, and communities. BRL+ challenges that reality by proving accessibility can be affordable, creative, and built from existing technology.

This project combines custom-designed hardware with a complete software pipeline that translates digital text into braille and drives a mechanical embossing system. We designed and 3D printed our own parts, replaced the printer’s hotend with a braille embossing mechanism, and integrated everything with a desktop application built using Electron and a Python backend. We also explored hands-free interaction through an autonomous voice agent powered by ElevenLabs to make the system more accessible.

BRL+ shows that accessibility challenges are often about cost, design, and priorities rather than missing technology. By reimagining everyday hardware, we demonstrate how powerful assistive tools can be made available to more people. This project is a step toward a future where access to information is a right, not a privilege.
